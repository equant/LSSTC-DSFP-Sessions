# PHYS366: Special Topics in Astrophysics: Statistical Methods

Course notes and resources for Stanford University graduate lecture course PHYS366.

### Course Description

This course is intended to provide an introduction to modern
statistical methodology, and its applications to problems in
astrophysics and cosmology, and is aimed at graduate students
intending to do research in this area. We
strongly encourage most first and second year students working in
KIPAC to take the course.  Our goal is to provide a background that
will be directly relevant to the kind of problems that typical KIPAC
students will encounter in their research.

### Course Objectives

Our goal is that students taking this course will:
* develop familiarity in working with various types of astronomical data.
* understand the role of modeling in data analysis.
* develop facility with various types of inference from data.
* be able to critically evaluate and apply commonly used statistical methodologies.
* be able to apply advanced statistical reasoning to problems they are likely to encounter in their research.

### Lessons

<!--
* **[Work through the lessons online.](http://mybinder.org/repo/KIPAC/StatisticalMethods)** [![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](http://mybinder.org/repo/KIPAC/StatisticalMethods)  
Getting the course notebooks online at `binder` can take a few minutes - and if you don't see the content you were expecting, that might be because the `binder` copy of the repo needs updating. You can do that yourself by re-entering `KIPAC/StatisticalMethods` in the form at [mybinder.org](http://mybinder.org), checking `requirements.txt` and then clicking "make my binder." The status of the most recent binder build can be viewed [here](http://mybinder.org/repo/KIPAC/StatisticalMethods/status).
