    "This is a course about data analysis, with examples from astronomy. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is designed to be interactive, and useful both to graduate students in the physics department at Stanford and elsewhere around the world. "

    "### Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "* Before we start, you should have worked through the [Getting Started page](https://github.com/drphilmarshall/StatisticalMethods/blob/master/doc/GettingStarted.md) on the course GitHub repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "* We will do a number of exercises in class as we go, to give you experience with the concepts, techniques and datasets we will be using. \n",
    "\n",
    "* You will need a computer, that is running git and IPython notebooks, to be able to work through these in-class exercises. If you are not set up, you can pair up with someone who has everything up and running.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Make sure you have forked and `git clone`'d the [course repository](https://github.com/drphilmarshall/StatisticalMethods), and have [The Plan notebook](../lessons/0.ThePlan.ipynb) open and running locally (that is, not just viewing it on GitHub). From there, you can navigate to the other lessons as we go. At this point, the URL in your browser window should say something like \"`http://localhost:8890/notebooks/lessons/0.ThePlan.ipynb`\""

    "\n",
    "* Assignments will appear on Tuesday each week in the [private base Homework repository](https://github.com/drphilmarshall/PHYS366-Homework-2015), announced via an issue in that repository. Fork it, so that you get the notification and can `git pull` the assignments.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Submission of your attempts at each problem is by _pull request_. \n",
    "\n",
    "* The first 20 minutes of each Tuesday class will be given over to looking at your solutions together: sign up on the Google spreadsheet provided in that week's homework issue thread.\n",
    "\n",
    "* After session 1 you will be able to do HW1 problem 1, parts a), b) and c). The other HW1 problems you will be able to do after session 2. This pattern is typical: plan on doing PHYS366 homework on Fridays!\n",

    "\n",
    "* You will need to submit a short written report (also by pull request). We will read the last version of your PDF file committed by midnight on Thursday October 28."
